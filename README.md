# gender-neutral-rewriter

This repository contains the code that was used to produce the neural gender-neutral rewriter models described in my Bachelor's Thesis "Adapting Gender-Inclusive Rewriting
Models to Gender-Neutral German".

## Data Creation

The directory `data_creation` contains the scripts used to create the training data for the trained models, including data extraction, replacement, round-trip translation and filtering.


## Evaluation

The directory `evaluation` contains the scripts used to create the test sets for the manual evaluation, the frequency distribution evaluation, the large scale evaluation and the copy evaluation and the respective scripts to evaluate them.

## Additional Resources

Additional scripts that were used for training and inference are found in the `scripts` directory. Finally, some utility scripts for data preparation are found in `utils`.
